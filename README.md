## Development Workflow

The development process follows these steps:

1. **Code Changes**: Make changes to the codebase on the local development machine
2. **Local Testing**: Test changes using local development servers
3. **Docker Build**: Build Docker containers for the updated services
4. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the containers to Google Cloud Run
5. **Verification**: Verify the changes in the production environment
6. **Documentation**: Update the README.md with details of the changes
7. **Version Control**: Commit changes to Git repository

**IMPORTANT**: When implementing new features, always remember to commit and push your changes to the Git repository. This ensures that all changes are properly tracked and that other team members have access to the latest code. Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the changes made.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process involves building and deploying both the backend and frontend services to Google Cloud Run. There are two main approaches to deployment: using local Docker or using Google Cloud Build directly.

### Backend Deployment (Recommended Method: Google Cloud Build)

The recommended approach is to use Google Cloud Build, which handles the Docker build process in the cloud:

1. **Build and Push the Container**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd /path/to/project/backend
   
   # Build the container using Google Cloud Build
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-backend
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy the container to Cloud Run
   gcloud run deploy podcast-backend \
     --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-backend:latest \
     --region us-west1 \
     --platform managed \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Key environment variables are set in the Dockerfile and during deployment
   - The service account credentials are included in the build
   - Additional environment variables can be set during deployment with `--set-env-vars`

### Backend Deployment (Alternative: Local Docker)

If you prefer to build locally first (requires Docker installed):

1. **Build the Container Locally**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd /path/to/project/backend
   
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-backend .
   
   # Push to Google Container Registry
   docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-backend
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run**: Same as in the recommended method.

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend deployment follows a similar process:

1. **Build and Push the Container**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory
   cd /path/to/project/frontend
   
   # Build the container using Google Cloud Build
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-frontend
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud Run**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy the container to Cloud Run
   gcloud run deploy podcast-frontend \
     --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/podcast-frontend:latest \
     --region REGION \
     --platform managed \
     --allow-unauthenticated
   ```

### Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

1. **Deployment Timeout**: 
   - If the deployment process seems to hang, try adding `--no-traffic --tag=new-version` to your deployment command
   - This will deploy a new revision without routing traffic to it immediately
   - You can then migrate traffic gradually using the Cloud Console

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Critical environment variables include `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, and `NODE_ENV`
   - To update environment variables without redeploying, use:
     ```bash
     gcloud run services update podcast-backend --set-env-vars=KEY=VALUE
     ```

3. **Service Account Permissions**:
   - Ensure the service account has proper permissions for Firestore, Storage, etc.
   - Check permissions in Google Cloud Console under IAM & Admin

4. **Debugging Deployed Services**:
   - Use Cloud Logging to view logs: `gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=podcast-backend"`
   - Set up Error Reporting in Google Cloud Console

### Configuration Updates

After deployment, additional configuration may be needed:

1. **Frontend Backend URL**:
   - The frontend needs to know the backend URL
   - This is typically set in the frontend's environment configuration

2. **Backend Configuration**:
   - The backend needs Google Cloud credentials
   - Configure the project ID for storage buckets
   - Set up API keys for external services

3. **Cloud Run Service Configuration**:
   - Memory allocation: Increase if needed for larger models
   - CPU allocation: Can be adjusted based on traffic
   - Concurrency: Adjust based on your application's needs

### Rollback Procedure

If a deployment causes issues:

1. **Identify Last Working Revision**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run revisions list --service=podcast-backend
   ```

2. **Rollback to Previous Revision**:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update-traffic podcast-backend --to-revisions=REVISION_NAME=100
   ```
