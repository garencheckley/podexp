## Notes
- Current working directory: `/Users/garen/Desktop/GCPG/frontend` 
- Backend compilation errors need fixing before deployment
- Production deployment is working but local dev is broken

## Next Actions
1. Fix TypeScript compilation errors
2. Resolve port conflict for local development  
3. Test fixes locally before next deployment
