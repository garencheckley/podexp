# Project Setup Progress

## Current Status
- Initial workspace check completed
- README.md reviewed
- Project appears to be a podcast generation system with frontend and backend components

## Next Steps
1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. Set up project dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run the project locally

## Notes
- Project uses Node.js/Express for backend
- React-based frontend
- Requires Google Cloud Platform services
- Uses TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- 2024-06-10: Updated UI to a modern, flat, dark theme. Reduced borders and fills, increased whitespace, and made buttons sleeker and more minimal. No changes to functionality. Main changes were in index.css and App.css. 

# Topic Selection Feature Implementation Plan

## Current System Analysis
- Currently: User clicks "Generate New Episode" â†’ System automatically selects topics and generates content
- Generation happens in `/backend/src/routes/podcasts.ts` in the `POST /:id/generate-episode` endpoint
- Topic selection logic is in lines 551-578 where system automatically picks topics based on newness and timeliness
- Frontend button in `PodcastDetail.tsx` (line 552) triggers `handleGenerateEpisode` which calls `generateEpisode` API

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. New API Endpoint: Get Topic Options
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/get-topic-options`
- **Purpose**: Run the initial analysis and topic discovery, return options to user
- **Steps**:
  1. Perform episode analysis (existing logic)
  2. Run initial search to find potential topics (existing logic)
  3. Return topic options to frontend instead of auto-selecting
- **Response**: Array of topic options with metadata (title, description, relevance score, recency info)

#### B. Modified API Endpoint: Generate Episode with Selected Topic
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/generate-episode`
- **New Parameter**: `selectedTopic` (optional - if not provided, auto-select for backward compatibility)
- **Logic**: Skip topic discovery/selection if selectedTopic provided, use it directly for deep research

#### C. New API Endpoint: Auto-Select Topic (Timeout)
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/auto-select-topic`
- **Purpose**: Called after 90s timeout to proceed with auto-selection
- **Logic**: Use existing topic selection logic to pick best option

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### A. New Component: TopicSelector
- **Purpose**: Display topic options as clickable buttons/cards
- **Features**:
  - Show topic title, description, relevance indicator
  - Countdown timer (90 seconds)
  - Auto-proceed after timeout
  - Loading states and error handling

#### B. Modified PodcastDetail Component
- **Flow**:
  1. User clicks "Generate New Episode"
  2. Button disabled, loading state shown
  3. Call `get-topic-options` API
  4. Show TopicSelector component
  5. User selects topic OR 90s timeout occurs
  6. Call `generate-episode` with selected topic
  7. Continue with normal generation flow

#### C. State Management
- New states: `showTopicSelector`, `topicOptions`, `selectedTopic`, `timeoutCountdown`
- Handle loading, error, and timeout states appropriately

### 3. UX Flow

1. **Initial State**: "Generate New Episode" button available
2. **User Clicks**: Button becomes "Thinking..." with spinner
3. **Topic Options Loaded**: Show topic selection interface with countdown
4. **User Selects OR Timeout**: Proceed to generation with chosen/auto-selected topic
5. **Generation**: Continue with existing flow (background generation notice)

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Topic Options Structure:
```typescript
interface TopicOption {
  id: string;
  topic: string;
  description: string;
  relevance: number;
  recency: string;
  query: string;
  reasoning: string;
}
```

#### Frontend Timeout Logic:
- 90-second countdown timer
- Visual countdown indicator
- Auto-proceed with most relevant topic if no selection
- Clear states properly on component unmount

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing API behavior when `selectedTopic` not provided
- Maintain current generation flow for any existing integrations

### 6. Error Handling
- Network failures during topic fetching
- Timeout during topic generation
- User navigating away during process
- Graceful fallback to auto-selection

### 7. Testing Strategy
- Test topic option generation with various podcast types
- Test timeout behavior (90s auto-select)
- Test user selection flow
- Test error scenarios and fallbacks

## Implementation Order
1. Create `get-topic-options` backend endpoint
2. Modify `generate-episode` to accept `selectedTopic`
3. Create `TopicSelector` frontend component
4. Integrate topic selection into `PodcastDetail`
5. Add timeout logic and auto-selection
6. Test end-to-end flow
7. Add error handling and edge cases

## Questions for Review
1. Should we store topic options temporarily in database or keep in memory?
   **ANSWER: Keep in memory (easiest to build and maintain)**

2. What happens if user has multiple browser tabs open during generation?
   **ANSWER: Do whatever is simplest - this is an edge case**

3. Should we allow canceling the generation process after topic selection?
   **ANSWER: Yes, provide a cancel option**

4. Any specific design preferences for the topic selection UI?
   **ANSWER: Simple design with buttons for each topic option**

5. Should the 90-second timeout be configurable?
   **ANSWER: Start with 90s fixed for now**

## Implementation Status
- âœ… Plan approved
- âœ… Step 1: Backend - Create get-topic-options endpoint
- âœ… Step 2: Backend - Modify generate-episode to accept selectedTopic
- âœ… Step 3: Frontend - Create TopicSelector component  
- âœ… Step 4: Frontend - Integrate topic selection into PodcastDetail
- âœ… Step 5: Frontend - Add timeout logic and auto-selection
- âœ… Step 6: Test end-to-end flow (TypeScript compilation successful)
- âœ… Step 7: Basic error handling implemented

### âœ… FEATURE COMPLETE âœ…

### Completed Features:
1. **Backend**: 
   - New `/get-topic-options` endpoint that performs analysis and returns topic choices
   - Modified `/generate-episode` endpoint to accept `selectedTopic` parameter
   - Maintains backward compatibility when no topic selected

2. **Frontend**:
   - `TopicSelector` component with 90-second countdown timer
   - Updated `PodcastDetail` with new topic selection flow
   - Button states: "Generate New Episode" â†’ "Thinking..." â†’ Topic Selection â†’ "Generating..."
   - Auto-selection after timeout
   - Cancel option during topic selection
   - No TypeScript compilation errors

### How It Works:
1. User clicks "Generate New Episode" â†’ Button shows "Thinking..."
2. System fetches topic options (performs analysis + search)
3. TopicSelector shows topic cards with 90-second countdown
4. User clicks a topic OR timeout auto-selects first topic
5. Episode generation proceeds with selected topic
6. Background generation notice appears as before
