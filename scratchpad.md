# Simplified Email-Based Authentication Plan

**Goal:** Implement the simplest possible email-based authentication system with minimal overhead.

## Phase 1: Backend Implementation

1. **Streamlined Login System:**
   - Create a single `loginTokens` collection in Firestore with schema:
     ```typescript
     interface LoginToken {
       token: string;        // UUID for the login token
       email: string;        // Email address as the user identifier
       createdAt: Timestamp; // When the token was created
     }
     ```
   - No expiration for tokens (simplifies logic)
   - No separate user records (just use email directly)

2. **Login Request Endpoint:**
   - Create `POST /api/auth/login-request` endpoint that:
     - Accepts an email address in the request body
     - Generates a unique login token (UUID v4)
     - Stores token in Firestore with the email
     - Sends an email with a login link: `https://yourapp.com/auth/verify?token=TOKEN`

3. **Email Service:**
   - Use the simplest email sending service available (Nodemailer or SendGrid)
   - Create minimal email template with just the login link

4. **Token Verification Endpoint:**
   - Create `GET /api/auth/verify` endpoint that:
     - Accepts just the `token` query parameter
     - Looks up the token in Firestore to get email
     - Sets a plain cookie with the user's email
     - Redirects to the main application
     - Optionally: Delete the token after use

5. **Simplified Authentication Middleware:**
   - Create lightweight middleware that:
     - Reads the email cookie
     - Attaches the email to the request object (e.g., `req.userId`)
     - No database validation - just trust the cookie

6. **Simplified Logout:**
   - Create `GET /api/auth/logout` endpoint that:
     - Clears the cookie
     - Redirects to login page

7. **Protect Endpoints:**
   - Apply the simple middleware to routes that need protection
   - Update query filters to use email as userId

## Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

1. **Simple Login Form:**
   - Single input field for email
   - Submit to `/api/auth/login-request`
   - Show "Check your email" message

2. **Verification Handling:**
   - No special handling needed - backend handles verification and sets cookie

3. **Basic Session Check:**
   - On app load, check if email cookie exists
   - If it exists, user is logged in
   - Display UI based on this simple check

4. **Logout Link:**
   - Simple link to `/api/auth/logout` (no form submission needed)

## Phase 3: Database Updates

1. **Podcast Ownership and Visibility:**
   - Update Podcast schema:
     ```typescript
     interface Podcast {
       // existing fields...
       ownerEmail: string;       // Email of the podcast creator
       visibility: "public" | "private"; // Default to "private"
     }
     ```
   - All new podcasts are created as "private" by default
   - Private podcasts are only visible to the owner
   - Public podcasts are visible to any logged-in user

2. **Migration:**
   - Simple script to add default owner email and visibility to existing podcasts

3. **Access Control Logic:**
   - Modify podcast listing endpoint to include:
     - All podcasts where `ownerEmail` matches the user's email
     - All podcasts where `visibility` is "public"
   - For podcast operations (create, update, delete):
     - Only allow if the user's email matches `ownerEmail`
   - For visibility changes:
     - Only the owner can toggle a podcast between private/public
     - Verify `ownerEmail` matches user's email before allowing visibility changes
   - For viewing a specific podcast:
     - Allow if the user's email matches `ownerEmail`
     - Allow if the podcast's `visibility` is "public"

4. **Visibility Toggle:**
   - Add a simple toggle in the podcast edit UI to switch between public/private
   - Toggle only appears for the podcast owner
   - Add endpoint to update visibility setting with owner verification

## Implementation Notes

1. **Extreme Simplifications:**
   - No password or account management
   - No token expiration
   - Email-in-cookie approach (simple but functional)
   - No session tracking or user records
   - GET request for logout (just a simple link)

2. **Security Considerations:**
   - This approach prioritizes simplicity over security
   - Cookie can be tampered with (but low risk for this application)
   - No CSRF protection (not needed for this use case)
   - No rate limiting (could be added if abuse becomes a problem)

3. **Multiple Device Support:**
   - Each device maintains its own cookie
   - No centralized session management
   - Login state persists until user clears cookies or logs out

4. **Visibility Model:**
   - Binary visibility option (private/public) for simplicity
   - New podcasts are private by default
   - Only the owner can change visibility settings
   - Owner always has full access to their podcasts
   - All authenticated users can see public podcasts
   - No anonymous access - must be logged in to see even public podcasts

This simplified approach eliminates unnecessary complexity while still achieving the core goals of user authentication and content visibility control.

## Implementation Update: Hybrid Authentication

We've successfully implemented the email-based authentication system with several enhancements to ensure it works reliably across different environments.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Backend Implementation**
   - Created email-based authentication endpoints `/api/auth/login-request` and `/api/auth/verify`
   - Implemented token generation and verification using Firestore
   - Set up email sending using Nodemailer with SendGrid
   - Added middleware for authenticating requests based on cookies or headers
   - Modified podcast queries to respect ownership and visibility settings

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Built login page with email input form
   - Created token verification page
   - Implemented authentication context to manage auth state
   - Added protected routes for securing content
   - Updated API client to support hybrid authentication

3. **Hybrid Authentication Approach**
   - Identified issues with HTTP-only cookies not working consistently across environments
   - Implemented a dual approach that tries both:
     - **Primary**: HTTP-only cookies for best security
     - **Fallback**: JavaScript-based authentication with localStorage + headers
   - Modified token verification to optionally return JSON instead of setting cookies
   - Updated API client to automatically append authentication headers when cookies aren't available

4. **CORS and Cookie Configuration**
   - Enhanced CORS settings to allow cookies and necessary headers
   - Configured cookies with appropriate security settings:
     - `secure: true` for HTTPS-only
     - `sameSite: 'none'` to work across domains
     - `path: '/'` for site-wide access
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging authentication issues

5. **Database Updates**
   - Added `ownerEmail` and `visibility` fields to Podcast schema
   - Created a migration script and updated existing podcasts
   - Implemented visibility toggle component
   - Updated podcast listing to show only owned or public podcasts

### Benefits

The hybrid authentication approach provides several advantages:
- Works reliably across different environments and browsers
- Maintains good security with HTTP-only cookies when supported
- Falls back to header-based auth when cookies don't work
- Provides a seamless user experience without complexity of password management

This implementation successfully meets our requirements for simple user authentication while ensuring the system works consistently across different deployment environments.

## Authentication System - Final Implementation Notes (May 2nd)

**Status:** Completed and Stable.

The hybrid email authentication system is now fully functional. Key aspects and troubleshooting notes:

1.  **Mechanism:** Uses magic links sent via email. The backend verifies the token.
    *   **Primary Auth:** Tries to set a secure, HTTP-only cookie (`userEmail`) with `SameSite=None; Secure`. This is the preferred, most secure method.
    *   **Fallback Auth:** If cookies fail (e.g., cross-domain issues, browser settings), the frontend verification step requests JSON, stores the email in `localStorage`, and sends it via the `X-User-Email` header in subsequent requests.
    *   **Backend Check:** The `authenticateToken` middleware checks for *either* the cookie *or* the header.

2.  **Key Challenges & Fixes:**
    *   **Cross-Domain Cookies:** Initial attempts with standard cookie settings failed due to the frontend and backend being on different `run.app` subdomains. Resolved by setting `secure: true` and `sameSite: 'none'` on the cookie and configuring backend CORS appropriately.
    *   **Firestore Index Errors (FAILED_PRECONDITION):** Complex queries in `getAllPodcasts` (combining owner check and public visibility) and later `getPodcast` required specific composite indexes in Firestore. These were identified via detailed backend logging and created manually in the Firebase console.
    *   **Debugging:** Added detailed logging (first `JSON.stringify`, then individual properties) to backend route handlers to pinpoint internal server errors, which was crucial for identifying the missing indexes.
    *   **Authorization Logic:** Ensured that routes fetching specific podcasts (`/api/podcasts/:id`) and episodes (`/api/podcasts/:podcastId/episodes`) correctly check ownership (`ownerEmail`) or public visibility against the authenticated user (`req.userId`). Initial versions had these checks commented out, leading to 404s (as the database function returned `null` for unauthorized access).

3.  **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    *   **Login Fails:** Check SendGrid logs (if email not received), check `loginTokens` collection in Firestore (if token not valid).
    *   **Requests Fail after Login (401/403):** Check `authenticateToken` middleware logs in backend (Cloud Logging). Verify if cookie or `X-User-Email` header is present and correct.
    *   **Requests Fail after Login (500):** Check backend logs (stderr) for the specific route handler (e.g., `GET /api/podcasts`). Look for detailed error messages (like index errors).
    *   **Requests Fail after Login (404 on Detail Pages):** Verify the authorization logic in the specific route handler (`GET /api/podcasts/:id`, `GET /api/podcasts/:podcastId/episodes`) is correctly checking ownership/visibility using `req.userId` passed to the database functions (`getPodcast`).
    *   **Firestore Index Errors:** Check backend logs (stderr) for `FAILED_PRECONDITION`. Use the link provided in the error or manually create the required composite index in the Firebase console.

See `AUTH_README.md` for a more comprehensive overview of the authentication flow.

## Debugging Synthesis Failure (May 2nd)

*   **Issue**: Episode generation failed with a generic "Synthesis failed" message on the frontend.
*   **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    *   Checked Cloud Run logs for `podcast-backend` around the failure time; no specific errors found initially.
    *   Enhanced error logging in `contentFormatter.ts` to capture more details from the Gemini API error object.
    *   Examined `narrativePlanner.ts` and the episode generation route in `podcasts.ts`.
    *   Re-deployed the backend with enhanced logging.
    *   Checked Cloud Run service environment variables using `gcloud run services describe`.
*   **Root Cause**: The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable was not set in the deployed Cloud Run service environment for `podcast-backend`, preventing successful calls to the Gemini API during the content synthesis step.
*   **Resolution**: 
    *   Located the API key in the local `backend/.env` file.
    *   Re-deployed the `podcast-backend` service using `gcloud run deploy`, explicitly setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY` using the `--set-env-vars` flag.
*   **Result**: Episode generation is now working correctly.

## Visibility Toggle & Deletion Fixes (May 2nd)

*   **Feature Added**: Implemented a public/private visibility toggle on the `PodcastDetail` page.
    *   Added backend endpoint logic (`PATCH /api/podcasts/:id`) to allow owners to update the `visibility` field.
    *   Added frontend API function (`updatePodcastVisibility`) and UI toggle component in `PodcastDetail.tsx`.
*   **Bug Fix (Visibility Update)**: Resolved a 404 error when updating visibility for private podcasts. The `PATCH /api/podcasts/:id` handler was incorrectly calling `getPodcast` without the user's email, causing the authorization check within `getPodcast` to fail for private podcasts.
    *   **Fix**: Passed `req.userId` to the `getPodcast` call within the `PATCH` handler.
*   **Bug Fix (Episode Deletion)**: Resolved a 401 Unauthorized error when deleting episodes. The `DELETE /api/podcasts/:podcastId/episodes/:episodeId` handler was using the incorrect `addAuthHeaders` setup in the frontend API call, potentially omitting the necessary `X-User-Email` header for the localStorage auth fallback.
    *   **Fix**: Updated the `deleteEpisode` function in `frontend/src/services/api.ts` to use the `addAuthHeaders` helper.
*   **Bug Fix (Podcast Deletion)**: Resolved a 401/403 error when deleting podcasts. The `DELETE /api/podcasts/:podcastId` handler had incorrect authorization logic, calling `getPodcast` without `req.userId` and comparing against `podcast.userId` instead of `podcast.ownerEmail`.
    *   **Fix**: Updated the handler to pass `req.userId` to `getPodcast` and compare `podcast.ownerEmail === req.userId`.
