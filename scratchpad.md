# Project Setup Progress

## Current Status
- Initial workspace check completed
- README.md reviewed
- Project appears to be a podcast generation system with frontend and backend components
- Topic selection feature successfully implemented and deployed

## Next Steps
1. Monitor topic selection feature in production
2. Gather user feedback on the new feature
3. Plan any necessary improvements based on usage patterns

## Notes
- Project uses Node.js/Express for backend
- React-based frontend
- Requires Google Cloud Platform services
- Uses TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- 2024-06-10: Updated UI to a modern, flat, dark theme. Reduced borders and fills, increased whitespace, and made buttons sleeker and more minimal. No changes to functionality. Main changes were in index.css and App.css. 

# Topic Selection Feature Implementation Plan

## Current System Analysis
- Currently: User clicks "Generate New Episode" â†’ System automatically selects topics and generates content
- Generation happens in `/backend/src/routes/podcasts.ts` in the `POST /:id/generate-episode` endpoint
- Topic selection logic is in lines 551-578 where system automatically picks topics based on newness and timeliness
- Frontend button in `PodcastDetail.tsx` (line 552) triggers `handleGenerateEpisode` which calls `generateEpisode` API

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Backend Changes

#### A. New API Endpoint: Get Topic Options
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/get-topic-options`
- **Purpose**: Run the initial analysis and topic discovery, return options to user
- **Steps**:
  1. Perform episode analysis (existing logic)
  2. Run initial search to find potential topics (existing logic)
  3. Return topic options to frontend instead of auto-selecting
- **Response**: Array of topic options with metadata (title, description, relevance score, recency info)

#### B. Modified API Endpoint: Generate Episode with Selected Topic
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/generate-episode`
- **New Parameter**: `selectedTopic` (optional - if not provided, auto-select for backward compatibility)
- **Logic**: Skip topic discovery/selection if selectedTopic provided, use it directly for deep research

#### C. New API Endpoint: Auto-Select Topic (Timeout)
- **Path**: `POST /api/podcasts/:id/auto-select-topic`
- **Purpose**: Called after 90s timeout to proceed with auto-selection
- **Logic**: Use existing topic selection logic to pick best option

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### A. New Component: TopicSelector
- **Purpose**: Display topic options as clickable buttons/cards
- **Features**:
  - Show topic title, description, relevance indicator
  - Countdown timer (90 seconds)
  - Auto-proceed after timeout
  - Loading states and error handling

#### B. Modified PodcastDetail Component
- **Flow**:
  1. User clicks "Generate New Episode"
  2. Button disabled, loading state shown
  3. Call `get-topic-options` API
  4. Show TopicSelector component
  5. User selects topic OR 90s timeout occurs
  6. Call `generate-episode` with selected topic
  7. Continue with normal generation flow

#### C. State Management
- New states: `showTopicSelector`, `topicOptions`, `selectedTopic`, `timeoutCountdown`
- Handle loading, error, and timeout states appropriately

### 3. UX Flow

1. **Initial State**: "Generate New Episode" button available
2. **User Clicks**: Button becomes "Thinking..." with spinner
3. **Topic Options Loaded**: Show topic selection interface with countdown
4. **User Selects OR Timeout**: Proceed to generation with chosen/auto-selected topic
5. **Generation**: Continue with existing flow (background generation notice)

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Topic Options Structure:
```typescript
interface TopicOption {
  id: string;
  topic: string;
  description: string;
  relevance: number;
  recency: string;
  query: string;
  reasoning: string;
}
```

#### Frontend Timeout Logic:
- 90-second countdown timer
- Visual countdown indicator
- Auto-proceed with most relevant topic if no selection
- Clear states properly on component unmount

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing API behavior when `selectedTopic` not provided
- Maintain current generation flow for any existing integrations

### 6. Error Handling
- Network failures during topic fetching
- Timeout during topic generation
- User navigating away during process
- Graceful fallback to auto-selection

### 7. Testing Strategy
- Test topic option generation with various podcast types
- Test timeout behavior (90s auto-select)
- Test user selection flow
- Test error scenarios and fallbacks

## Implementation Order
1. Create `get-topic-options` backend endpoint
2. Modify `generate-episode` to accept `selectedTopic`
3. Create `TopicSelector` frontend component
4. Integrate topic selection into `PodcastDetail`
5. Add timeout logic and auto-selection
6. Test end-to-end flow
7. Add error handling and edge cases

## Questions for Review
1. Should we store topic options temporarily in database or keep in memory?
   **ANSWER: Keep in memory (easiest to build and maintain)**

2. What happens if user has multiple browser tabs open during generation?
   **ANSWER: Do whatever is simplest - this is an edge case**

3. Should we allow canceling the generation process after topic selection?
   **ANSWER: Yes, provide a cancel option**

4. Any specific design preferences for the topic selection UI?
   **ANSWER: Simple design with buttons for each topic option**

5. Should the 90-second timeout be configurable?
   **ANSWER: Start with 90s fixed for now**

   - Button states: "Generate New Episode" â†’ "Thinking..." â†’ Topic Selection â†’ "Generating..."
   - Auto-selection after timeout
   - Cancel option during topic selection
   - No TypeScript compilation errors

### How It Works:
1. User clicks "Generate New Episode" â†’ Button shows "Thinking..."
2. System fetches topic options (performs analysis + search)
3. TopicSelector shows topic cards with 90-second countdown
4. User clicks a topic OR timeout auto-selects first topic
5. Episode generation proceeds with selected topic
6. Background generation notice appears as before

## Session Notes

### Latest Progress - Hybrid Topic Service Integration (Current Session)

#### Implementation Summary
Successfully integrated a **hybrid topic service** that combines both Gemini and Perplexity Sonar APIs to improve episode topic selection:

#### New Files Created:
1. **`backend/src/services/hybridTopicService.ts`** - Main hybrid service
   - Combines Gemini and Perplexity APIs in parallel
   - Smart prompts optimized for each API's strengths:
     - **Perplexity Sonar**: Real-time search, breaking news, timeliness (7-10 days)
     - **Gemini**: Analytical depth, broader context, unique perspectives (14 days)
   - Intelligent ranking and deduplication
   - Hybrid scoring system with quality metrics

#### Modified Files:
1. **`backend/src/services/searchOrchestrator.ts`**
   - Updated to use hybrid service as primary topic discovery method
   - Maintains fallback chain: Hybrid â†’ Original Gemini â†’ Search-based
   - Added metadata tracking for API success rates

#### Key Features:
- **Parallel API Execution**: Both APIs called simultaneously for speed
- **Smart Deduplication**: Removes similar topics across APIs
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Scoring based on relevance, recency, sources, depth
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System still works if either API fails
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks success rates and performance metrics

#### API Prompt Strategies:
**Perplexity (Real-time focus):**
- Optimized for breaking news and trending topics
- 7-10 day recency window
- Emphasis on authoritative sources and citations
- Focus on "what's happening now"

**Gemini (Analytical focus):**
- Optimized for depth and analytical potential
- 14-day recency window  
- Emphasis on multiple perspectives and storytelling
- Focus on "what does this mean"

#### Environment Setup:
- Added `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` to environment variables
- Installed `axios` and `@types/axios` dependencies

#### Integration Benefits:
1. **Better Topic Quality**: Combines real-time data with analytical depth
2. **Improved Relevance**: Dual scoring from different AI perspectives  
3. **Higher Success Rate**: Fallback chain ensures topics are always found
4. **Rich Metadata**: Tracking which APIs contribute to better optimization
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more APIs or adjust weighting

#### Deployment Status:
âœ… **SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION!** âœ…
